# ECE-113---DSP
This class consists of 3 mini projects, especially focusing on Lab 1 and 2.
These labs are very interesting, however, one would need the RTL-SDR dongle which can be used as a computer based radio scanner for receiving live radio signals, to run this code.
In case of having a hard time getting a good signal, we were also provided a pre-collected data (provided by UC Berkeley).
It's impossible to run code without using either USB dongle or Pre-collected data, but these DSP concepts are well formed and could be used as a good reference.
